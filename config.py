# headline-driven score swings were noise (e.g. PSO flipping run-to-run on a
# single live-blog headline). macro_news and sentiment weights are now ZERO —
# both sections are still COMPUTED for display and to drive the bad-news / pump
# SAFETY vetoes in risk_manager, but neither moves the score. Fundamentals is
# also 0 (confirmed manually). So final_score == technical score. Must sum to 1.0.
# To re-enable news, restore e.g. technical 0.55 / macro_news 0.20 / sentiment 0.25.
WEIGHTS = {"technical": 1.0, "fundamentals": 0.0,

# Buy threshold raised 70 -> 75 (2026-08-12 audit of day-deduped graded runs).
# Score band vs 3-day win rate: 70-75 won 30% (n=66), 75-80 won 68% (n=28),
# 80+ won 86% (n=7). Two-thirds of Buys were coming from the WORST band. At
# score>=75 the candidate win rate is 75% (n=81) vs 56% at >=70 (n=198) — fewer
# signals, materially better ones.

# Hysteresis dead-band around the SIGNAL_THRESHOLDS. A raw score grazing a
# threshold (e.g. 69.5 vs 70.5) shouldn't flip Buy↔Watch run-to-run — that's
# scoring noise, not signal. Once a stock is at level X, its final_score must
# cross the next threshold by at least this many points BEFORE flipping. Same
# pattern as the existing conviction-streak gate (which requires Strong Buy to
# confirm), but applied to band edges. Set to 0 to disable.

# Evidence-based Buy gates. Re-measured 2026-08-12 on day-deduped graded runs
# (15-min polling inflates raw counts ~20x, so every figure here is one row per
# symbol per day):
#   * The pullback-entry UPGRADE is REMOVED. Buys it created (final_score <70)
#     won 9% (n=57) against a 38% market base rate — it was subtracting edge,
#     not adding it. The pullback SETUP is still detected and displayed
#     (technical['pullback_ready'] + the buy-zone) as manual context.
#   * RS laggard veto raised 45 -> 55. RS<45 won 21%, 45-55 won 21%, 55-70 won
#     24%, 70+ won 36%. A 70 cut looks best alone, but stacked on the new
#     score>=75 threshold it gives NO accuracy gain (75% either way) while
#     halving trade count (n=81 -> 40); at 55 the stack wins 77% (n=53).

#   * CMF > 0.10 .................. 61% beat, +2.07% excess (n=62)  <- the ONLY
#     leading indicator with edge; it reads real high/low money flow.
#   * CMF > 0.10 inside score 60-75 ... 75% beat, +2.70% (n=16, small)
# What it does NOT support (measured, rejected — do not resurrect without new
# evidence):
#   * accumulation_candidate ...... 47% beat at 3d, 53% at 7d (no edge)
#   * OBV bullish divergence ...... 44% / 45% (NEGATIVE)
#   * OBV up while price flat ..... 40% / 37% (NEGATIVE)
#   * score velocity (3-day rise) . 45% when rising fast (NEGATIVE)
